## [The Code](https://replit.com/@ArthurBernier/Connect-Four-Game-Donna-Frances)

_Following our previous group lab assignment, we'll continue with a new set of discussion questions. For Day 2, you'll be focusing on potential modifications to the Connect Four game. In your groups, consider the following questions:_

<hr>

1. How would you modify the code to change player 1 and player 2 colors to pink and green, respectively?
2. What modifications would you need to make to add a "click" sound effect every time a player drops a coin into a column?
3. How could you implement background music that plays during the game and success music when a player wins?
4. How would you modify the game to allow for different board sizes (e.g., 5x5 or 10x10)?
5. How would you alter the code to enable a different win condition, such as connecting five coins instead of four?
6. How would you add an animation effect when a player drops a coin, making it appear to fall into place?
7. What changes would you need to make to display the total number of moves made during a game?
8. How would you implement a feature that allows players to undo their last move?
9. How could you add an AI opponent for a single-player mode?
10. Reflecting on what you've learned from analyzing the Connect Four code, how might you begin building a game like Tetris? What similarities and differences would you expect in the implementation?

Assignment Details:

1. Continue working in your groups from Day 1.
2. Discuss and explore solutions to the 10 questions provided.
3. Each group must document their proposed solutions and ideas for each question because you will need them for when you combine into your big groups



We encourage you to think creatively about the possible changes and improvements to the Connect Four game. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification during the lab session or via the classroom chat.

Good luck, and enjoy modifying the game!
