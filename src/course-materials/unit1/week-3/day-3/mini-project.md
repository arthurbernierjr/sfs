# Brooklyn Layout Mini-Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Brooklyn Layout Mini-Project! In this exercise, you'll have the opportunity to recreate the layout of the Brook & Lyn website. This is a hands-on task that will test your web design and coding skills, emphasizing on layout structure and styling.

## Project Timeline

- **Assigned Date**: 10/7/2023
- **Due Date**: 10/14/2023

## Platforms

- Acceptable platforms: Repl.it or CodeSandbox.
- Codepen is **not** acceptable for this project.

## Task Description

You have two options for this project:

1. **Option A**: Use the Brooklyn website design mockup that we provide below.
2. **Option B**: Choose any website on the internet that showcases content cards and attempt to recreate its layout.

### The Brook & Lyn Mockup:

### Instructions:

1. **Setup**: If you're opting for the Brook & Lyn design (Option A), you'll find all necessary images in the provided `brooklyn/images` folder. In either Repl or Codesandbox create an `index.html` and `styles.css` file. Ensure you link the two together correctly.
2. **Recreation**: Pay attention to the details. Consider aspects like font size, color schemes, margins, paddings, and alignments. Try to make your version as close to the mockup as possible.
3. **Content Cards**: If you're selecting another website (Option B), focus especially on areas with content cards. Replicate the layout, content positioning, and any hover or active effects they might have.
4. **Completion**: Once you're done, ensure your project is publicly available and running smoothly on either Repl.it or CodeSandbox. Share the live link on this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUG35UAE0o0GGQ5wMpHaYyB5jGs3jNyWvJWlkHuZCME/edit?usp=sharing.

### Points to Consider:

- Think about the responsiveness of your layout. How will it look on different screen sizes?
- Consider the user experience. Ensure clickable elements have adequate feedback.
- Stick to best practices in terms of file organization, code commenting, and naming conventions.

### Key Takeaways:

- This project is not just about replicating a design but understanding the nuances of web layouts and the decisions frontend devs make.
- Focus on details. The closer your recreation is to the mockup or the original website (for Option B), the better you've understood and implemented the design intricacies.
- Think out-of-the-box. Use this opportunity to experiment with any additional styling or effects you believe could enhance the design.

Good luck and happy coding!
