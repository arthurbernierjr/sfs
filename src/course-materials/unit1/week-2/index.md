**Reminder:** After completing every two-week block, students should book a one-on-one meeting with the instructor for at least one hour to review progress, address questions, and receive personalized feedback.

This format ensures students work independently, with regular feedback via text, and provides structured guidance for meeting with the instructor after each two-week block. Let me know if you need further customization!
