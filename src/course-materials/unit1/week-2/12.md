# **Lesson 12: Final Review and Homework Project**

### **Goal**  
Review the full-stack **TodoList App**, summarize the key concepts learned, and assign a **final project** to solidify knowledge.

---

## **1. Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
1. Understand how the **frontend**, **backend**, and **AI integrations** come together.  
2. Review key concepts, challenges, and solutions from building the app.  
3. Start a **new project** to reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned.

## **2. Full-Stack TodoList App: Recap**

Hereâ€™s an overview of what we built:

### **Backend (Express & MongoDB)**  
- Set up a REST API using **Express**.  
- Integrated **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for storing tasks.  
- Added AI-powered features using the **OpenAI API**.  
- Tested the backend with **Jest**, **Supertest**, and **MongoMemoryServer**.

### **Frontend (React, TanStack, Radix UI)**  
- Built the UI with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
- Managed server-side state using **TanStack/React Query**.  
- Implemented navigation with **TanStack/React Router**.  
- Styled components using **Radix UI** and **Phosphor Icons**.  
- Added loading/error states to improve UX.

### **Deployment**  
- Deployed the backend on **Render**.  
- Hosted the frontend on **Vercel**.  
- Configured environment variables to connect both.

## **3. Key Learnings**

1. **TypeScript**: Enforced type safety across frontend and backend code.  
2. **React Query**: Simplified data fetching, caching, and mutations.  
3. **Express API**: Created robust RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.  
4. **AI Integration**: Used OpenAI to automate task descriptions and schedules.  
5. **Testing**: Wrote tests to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.  
6. **Deployment**: Published a full-stack app using Render and Vercel.

## **4. Homework: Final Project**

For your final project, youâ€™ll build a **Bookmarks App** that allows users to save, manage, and delete bookmarks.

### **Requirements**  

#### **Backend** (Express & MongoDB):  
1. **Create a REST API** with the following endpoints:  
   - `POST /api/bookmarks` â†’ Add a new bookmark.  
   - `GET /api/bookmarks` â†’ Retrieve all bookmarks.  
   - `DELETE /api/bookmarks/:id` â†’ Delete a bookmark by ID.  

2. **Bookmark Schema**:  
   - `title` (string, required).  
   - `url` (string, required).  
   - `description` (string, optional).  

3. Add **validation** for the `url` field.

---

#### **Frontend** (React, React Query, Radix UI):  
1. **Build the UI**:  
   - Input field to add a new bookmark (`title` and `url`).  
   - Display bookmarks in a list.  
   - Add a **delete** button for each bookmark.  

2. **Fetch and Update Data**:  
   - Use **React Query** to manage API calls.  
   - Show **loading** and **error** states.  

3. **Styling**:  
   - Use **Radix UI** for inputs and buttons.  
   - Add icons with **Phosphor Icons**.  

---

#### **Optional AI Feature**  
Use the **OpenAI API** to auto-generate a description for a bookmark based on the URL or title.  

---

### **Submission Requirements**  
1. Deploy the backend on **Render** and the frontend on **Vercel**.  
2. Submit the following:  
   - Live links to the **backend** and **frontend**.  
   - A GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code.  
   - A short write-up describing challenges faced and solutions implemented.
