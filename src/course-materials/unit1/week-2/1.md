# **Lesson 1: Breaking Down the TodoList App**

### **Goal**:  
Understand what we are building, why we are building it, and how the specified technologies fit into the project.

---

### **1. Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lesson, students will:  
- Understand the full scope of the TodoList app and its functionalities.  
- Analyze how each feature maps to the app's technologies.  
- Visualize the app workflow, including backend API interactions and frontend UI design.  
- Gain clarity on what the AI integration entails.  

---

### **2. App Overview**
We are creating a **TodoList Application** with the following core functionalities:  

1. **Creating a Todo**: Users can add tasks to their list.  
2. **Viewing Tasks**: Tasks will be displayed in two columns:  
    - Incomplete Tasks  
    - Completed Tasks  
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from either column.  
4. **AI-Assisted Features**:  
   - Generate a task description using AI during task creation.  
   - Generate a task schedule based on user time input and task durations.  
   - Suggest subtasks required to complete a main task.

### **3. Key Technologies**
Here is a breakdown of the technologies we will use and their roles:

#### **Languages**:  
- **JavaScript**: Base programming language for this project.  
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing, making the app more robust and maintainable.  

#### **Frontend**:  
1. **React**: Component-based UI framework for building the user interface.  
2. **TanStack/React Query**: Manages server-state data (e.g., fetching, caching, and synchronizing backend data).  
3. **TanStack/React Router**: Provides routing for page navigation and deep links.  
4. **Radix UI**: Provides accessible and customizable UI components to save development time.  
5. **Phosphor Icons**: Icon library for enhancing the appâ€™s user interface.  

#### **Backend**:  
1. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing todo items.  
2. **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB, making database interactions easier.  
3. **Express**: Backend server framework to handle API requests and integrate with MongoDB.  
4. **OpenAI API**: Provides AI-powered features such as task descriptions, schedules, and subtasks.  

#### **Testing**:  
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript.  
- **Supertest**: Used to test HTTP endpoints.  
- **MongoMemoryServer**: Allows in-memory MongoDB testing for speed and isolation.  

---

### **4. App Architecture**
We will break the project into two main parts:  

#### **Backend**  
- **Server**: Built using Express and Mongoose to handle the API.  
- **OpenAI Integration**: Connected to provide AI-generated content.  

#### **Frontend**  
- **React Components**: UI components built with Radix UI and Phosphor Icons.  
- **State Management**: Handled using TanStack/React Query.  
- **Routing**: Managed using TanStack/React Router.  

#### **Data Flow**  
The diagram below maps out the app's data flow between the **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **OpenAI API**:

```
[Frontend] --> User Inputs --> [Backend API] --> Save to MongoDB
[Frontend] <-- Fetch Todos <-- [Backend API] <-- MongoDB

AI Integration:
[Frontend] --> Request AI Features --> [Backend API] --> OpenAI API
[Frontend] <-- Receive AI Response <-- [Backend API]
```

| **Feature**                          | **Action**                           | **Technologies**                       |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Create a Todo Item                   | User adds a new task                 | React, Express, MongoDB                |
| View Todo Items (2 Columns)          | Fetch incomplete/completed tasks     | React, TanStack Query, Express         |
| Delete a Todo Item                   | User removes a task                  | React, Express, MongoDB                |
| AI: Generate Task Description        | Use AI to auto-create descriptions   | OpenAI API, Express, React             |
| AI: Schedule Tasks                   | AI generates a time-based schedule   | OpenAI API, Express, React             |
| AI: Suggest Subtasks                 | AI provides subtasks for a task      | OpenAI API, Express, React             |

### **6. Homework Assignment**
**Goal**: Analyze the requirements of the TodoList App.

1. Write down a **step-by-step flow** of how a user will interact with the app.  
2. Create a **diagram** of the app architecture based on the explanation.  
3. List all the **technologies** and briefly explain their role in the app.  
4. Describe the **AI features** in your own words and how they improve the app.
