## Monthly Video Learning Sessions

Every month, or semi-monthly based on class pace, you'll participate in a unique learning experience: `Monthly Video Learning Sessions`.

These curated videos are accessible either via the official class website or the GA portal. 

### Timing and Scheduling

You'll receive a dedicated time slot to complete these video sessions. Think of it like a reading assignment, only more dynamic and interactive.

### Post-Video Activities

Once you've completed watching the video, one of two enriching follow-up activities awaits you:

1. **Instructor-Led Q&A**: Engage in a vibrant discussion with your instructor to clarify doubts and explore key insights.
  
2. **Group Lab Exercise**: Collaborate with your assigned team to tackle a hands-on lab activity, applying what you've learned.

#### Key Takeaways

- Monthly Video Learning Sessions enrich the traditional classroom experience.
- A specific time slot ensures focused engagement.
- Post-video activities, either a Q&A or lab exercise, reinforce the material and encourage active learning.
