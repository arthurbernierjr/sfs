# Collaborative Programming: Pairs and Groups

Welcome to a vital component of your learning experience—Pair and Group Programming. Embracing this practice is non-negotiable, as it's a standard in top tech firms and an invaluable teaching tool. 

Explore the value of pair programming further in this [article](https://karimfanous.substack.com/p/pair-programming-why-you-should-do). Remember, coding isn't a solitary endeavor; it’s a team sport. Consider this: when a VIP faces a health challenge, they don't consult just one doctor but assemble a medical team.

## Your Role in Breakout Rooms

During the course, you'll find yourself in breakout rooms, either as a pair or part of a larger group. 

### In a Pair:
1. **Driver**: Executes the code. Shares their screen.
2. **Navigator**: Guides the Driver. No typing.
3. **Dynamic Roles**: Alternate between Driver and Navigator.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Drivers can offer feedback, but Navigators lead.

### In a Group:
1. **Screen Sharer**: Shares the screen and acts as the Recorder.
2. **Recorder**: Takes meeting minutes.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Everyone communicates openly.
4. **Summary**: Recorder shares minutes post-session.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Ignoring the task at hand by working on other assignments.
- Turning off your camera and disengaging.
- Speaking over teammates or providing solutions without context.
- Using unauthorized sources for answers, bypassing credible documentation like MDN, W3C, or ECMAScript docs.

## Pro Tips
- **Documentation is Key**: Consult credible sources to find answers.
- **Review Course Material**: Your best resource is often what you’ve already been taught.
- **Use Bonus Texts**: Don't overlook any supplemental materials provided.
- **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: Collaboration is crucial for problem-solving.

#### Key Takeaways

- Collaborative programming is vital for your career and learning.
- Roles in breakout rooms are designed to simulate real-world coding environments.
- Unacceptable behavior disrupts the learning experience for everyone.
- Utilizing all available resources and effective teamwork leads to problem-solving success.
