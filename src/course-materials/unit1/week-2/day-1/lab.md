## Getting Started with the Basics

1. Inside CodeSandbox, create a new project and name it `resume_page`.
2. In this project, create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.
3. In `index.html`, add the HTML boilerplate code.
4. Include an `h1` tag with the text "Grumpy Cat".
5. Preview your project in the browser to ensure setup is correct.


## Give an emoji in slack on the message that says "Resume index.html file is set up".

## Adding Content to the Resume Page

1. Add an image of Grumpy Cat using the `img` tag. Place it below the `h1` tag.
2. Use an `ul` tag to list Grumpy Cat's past three work positions.
3. Add dummy links for LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter using the `a` tag.
4. Insert `h3` headings before the list of work positions and the social media links.

## Give an emoji in slack on the message that says "Added initial content for resume site".

## Styling the Resume Page

Feel free to style your site as you wish. Some ideas:

1. Center-align the `h1` tag.
2. Change the `h1` font.
3. Alter the `h3` tag font color.
4. Add margin or padding to the body for a polished look.

## Adding Navigation to the Resume Page

1. Create a navigation bar (`nav` tag) containing the social media links.
2. Remove the previous links you had below the `ul` tag.
3. Add links in the navigation bar for `Home Page` and `Projects`.
4. Create a new HTML file named `projects.html`.
5. Copy the navigation and head information from `index.html` to `projects.html`.
6. Inside `projects.html`, insert an `h2` tag with the text "Projects".
7. Confirm that the navigation links work correctly.
8. List three projects Grumpy Cat has worked on, either as an ordered list or in a three-column layout.

## Give an emoji in slack on the message that says "Added project.html page and content - finished resume".
