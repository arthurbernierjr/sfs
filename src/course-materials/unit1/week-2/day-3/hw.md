#### 1) Written HW: HTML & CSS Grid Questions

**Instructions**: Answer the following 10 questions related to HTML and CSS Grid. This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of the layout mechanisms.

1. What is the role of the `display: grid;` property in CSS?
2. How do you define rows and columns in a CSS grid layout?
3. What is the purpose of `grid-template-areas`?
4. How can you make a grid item span multiple rows or columns?
5. Explain the use of `grid-gap`.
6. What is the difference between `grid-template-columns` and `grid-auto-columns`?
7. What does the `justify-items` property do in a grid layout?
8. How does `align-items` affect grid items?
9. What is the function of the `grid-area` property?
10. Describe a scenario where Flexbox is more appropriate to use than CSS Grid.

### Instructions

1. Go to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and create a new pen.
1. Answer the above questions in the html tab 
1. Create an `ol`
1. Then create an `li` for each question
1. Inside each `li` place 2 `span` tags
1. In 1 `span` tag write the question
1. In the other `span` tag write the answer
1. Above the `ol` add a `h1` tag and put your name in the `h1`

#### 2) Practical HW: CSS Grid & Flexbox Layout

**Platform**: CodeSandbox  
**Goal**: Create a 3x3 layout using CSS Grid, populate squares with X's and O's, and center them using Flexbox.

**Instructions**: 

1. Create a new project on CodeSandbox and name it "3x3 Grid Layout".
2. Use CSS Grid to create a 3-row by 3-column layout.
3. Place X's and O's in the squares.
4. Use Flexbox to center the X's and O's within each square.

**Tips**: 

- Utilize `justify-content: center;` and `align-items: center;` for Flexbox centering.
- Make use of `grid-template-areas` for easier layout management.

#### 3) Theoretical HW: Easy-Level JavaScript Challenge

**Challenge**: "The Alphabet Printer"

**Goal**: Write a JavaScript function that prints each letter of the alphabet on a new line.

**Instructions**:

1. Write a function named `printAlphabet`.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the values of 'a' to 'z'.
4. Print each letter on a new line.
5. If the letter is a vowel, captalize it.

#### Key Takeaways:

- These homework assignments are designed to deepen your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- They build upon the skills you've acquired during the Flexbox/CSS Grid class & lab.
- The theoretical hw builds upon your fizzbuzz solutions, but the way you get the answer will not be a mathematical operation. (the answer is closer than it appears)
- Proper submission ensures that your progress can be tracked and that you receive appropriate feedback.

## Tips

#### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6.
    - Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line.

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

#### Links (`<a>` tags)

* Links on the page should be red (#ff3300) and not be underlined.
