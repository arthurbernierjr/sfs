# **Introduction to AI Prompting**

### **Lesson Objective**
By the end of this lesson, you will understand the basics of prompt engineering, including different types of prompts and how to craft effective prompts for AI models. This knowledge will form the foundation for interacting effectively with AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT.

## **Lesson Outline**

### **1. What is Prompt Engineering?**
Prompt engineering involves designing and refining the input (prompt) given to an AI model to get the best possible output. Just as asking the right question can lead to better answers, well-crafted prompts guide AI toward relevant, accurate, and valuable responses.

#### **Why Prompt Engineering is Important**
- **Efficiency**: Well-structured prompts save time by reducing irrelevant or incomplete responses.
- **Clarity**: Precise prompts reduce ambiguity, helping the AI model understand exactly what you need.
- **Relevance**: A good prompt leads the AI to provide responses that align with your goals, whether for generating text, answering questions, or automating tasks.

### **2. Types of Prompts**

Understanding the different types of prompts helps in tailoring input to achieve various outcomes. Here are some of the main prompt types:

#### **Descriptive Prompts**
- These prompts provide detailed instructions to the AI, specifying the desired structure, length, or tone of the response.
- **Example**: “Write a three-paragraph summary of the benefits of regular exercise, focusing on physical, mental, and emotional health.”

#### **Conversational Prompts**
- Used for interactive exchanges, conversational prompts guide the AI to respond as if in dialogue, maintaining context across multiple turns.
- **Example**: “Imagine you are a career coach. Give me three tips on how to improve my job interview skills.”

#### **Creative/Generative Prompts**
- Open-ended prompts that encourage the AI to create content, such as stories, poems, or ideas.
- **Example**: “Write a short story about a scientist who discovers a new form of energy.”

#### **Instructional Prompts**
- These prompts guide the AI to explain or teach a concept in detail.
- **Example**: “Explain the concept of photosynthesis as if teaching it to a fifth grader.”

### **3. Crafting Effective Prompts**

To get the most accurate and relevant responses, keep the following best practices in mind when crafting prompts:

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Avoid ambiguity by specifying details, such as length, format, or subject.
  - **Example**: Instead of “Describe machine learning,” use “Describe the role of machine learning in data analysis in 2-3 paragraphs.”

- **Provide Context**: Adding background information or framing helps the AI better understand the topic.
  - **Example**: “As a financial advisor, give me advice on saving for retirement.”

- **Set Expectations**: Specify the tone, formality, or perspective (e.g., beginner-friendly, expert level).
  - **Example**: “Write a professional email to a client apologizing for a delay in their order.”

- **Iterate and Refine**: Sometimes, achieving the desired output requires trial and error. Start with a simple prompt and adjust it based on the responses.

### **4. Hands-On Prompt Practice**

#### **Exercise: Writing Basic Prompts**
- Write a prompt that asks the AI to provide a short, two-paragraph explanation of how solar panels work.
- Write a creative prompt that asks the AI to generate a plot for a science fiction movie.

#### **Exercise: Adjusting Tone and Detail**
- Start with the prompt, “Explain blockchain.”
- Refine this prompt to ask for a simple, one-paragraph explanation for beginners.
- Next, adjust the prompt to request a technical, in-depth explanation aimed at software engineers.
