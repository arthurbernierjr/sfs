# Lord of the Objects

![LOTR](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/KzQhmyc.jpg)

## First in order for us to do this activity we need to get used to a tool called GIT

## Learning Objectives

| Student will be able to: |
|---|
| Describe what a Version Control System is |
| Describe the difference between Git and GitHub |
| Distinguish between local and remote repositories |


<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is version control, and why should you care?

A Version Control System (VCS) records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

It also makes working in teams easier, because it enables developers to submit changes to be merged into the codebase.

More specifically, a VCS allows you to:

- Revert files back to a previous state
- Review changes made over time
- Collaborate on a set of files with others
- Create separate "branches" of the codebase to develop new features on without impacting the "master", or production, branch.

In this program, we'll be using the world's most popular version control system - **git**.

Git was created by Linus Torvolds in 2005 to help with the development of his main project at the time - developing Linux.

<br>
<br>

## Git vs. GitHub vs Git.Generalassemb.ly

GitHub is not the same as git. **GitHub** is a social network built around git. It has completely changed the way we, as programmers, share and work on code. GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative works, and it works with git in order to keep track of versions, issues, and requests for changes.

GitHub also plays the important role of a cloud-based backup system - a safe place for all your work!  Your code, and the time you spent writing it, is valuable, therefore, you don't want to risk losing it to hardware failure, etc. So we "connect" our local git repo to a "remote" repo on GitHub where we can then "push" code to, and "pull" code from - on demand.

Now your git.generalassemb.ly account is a `fake` github account that is there for you to practice. No one can see your git.generalassembly account except ga employees and students. We will always refer to this in class as Github Enterprise because this is the tool we use to run our own personal github just for general assembly. But keep in mind your github enterprise is `fake` its not real. You can never use it as a way to login to another site, you can never put a portfolio on it, you can never do anything on it that is supposed to live after you graduate.

In summary:

- Git provides us with local repositories on our computers
- GitHub provides us with remote repositories stored in the cloud
- A local repository is "linked" to a remote repository by adding a "remote" with this command `$ git remote add <name of remote> <URL of repo on GitHub>`
- your ga github enterprise is fake, its not real, its just for practice and will dissapear when you graduate class. Everything real goes on the real github. Don't confuse them.

## Summary of Common Git Commands

By following along today and having done the pre-work, you should now be familiar with basic git commands.

In SEIR, you'll get plenty of practice using git, especially during project week because each of your projects will be stored in its own directory and will be made a git repository in that directory tracking the changes.


For your convenience, <a href="/downloads/frontend_fundamentals/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf" download>Click Here</a> for a Git Cheatsheet.

<br>
<br>
<br>


However for a quick reference, the following summary of commands will "git" you far:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `git init` | Initializes a local repository. Used in lieu of cloning a GitHub repo. All local repos contain a hidden `.git` directory responsible for holding repo-related data. |
| `git status` | Checks and reports on the status of your repo. It will inform you what changes to tracked (staged) files will be included in next commit, if there are any untracked files that have been added to the project or have changes, etc. |
| `git add <path>` | Adds an entire directory or individual file (or files using a `*` as a wildcard) to the "staging area" for the next commit. |
| `git add -A`| Adds all changes within the repo to the staging are for next commit. |
| `git commit -m "<message>"`| Commits all staged changes to the local repo. The message should be in worded such that it describes what the commit **does**, not what it **did**. For example, "Style nav bar" instead of "Styled nav bar".|

<br>
<br>
<br>

This graph diagrams the flow of making changes to a repo:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MGQoFYo.png">

This is the most simple workflow, things get a bit more complex when you start sharing code and manage larger codebases. We'll eventually get there, don't worry about branches, pull requests, diffs and other things until we get to that point.

> IMPORTANT: Do not create a repo within an existing repo!  If you find your computer very sluggish, it might be because you have "nested" repos. It's not uncommon for students to accidentally make their home folder (`~`) a repo - so start there if you suspect something is wrong. Talk to an IA first.

# Conclusion

You will "git" plenty of practice as we progress through this program, so if the concept of git/github still seems a little fuzzy at this point, rest assured you will soon "git" it once you "git" some more practice in. ðŸ˜Ž


##  Add an ssh key to your github account

- When you get tired of always entering your github password, you can use the ssh URL (as opposed to the https URL) when cloning a repo
- You'll need to also add what's called an ssh key to github https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
- Now you can use the ssh url when cloning instead of https

1. go into ssh directory `cd ~/.ssh`
2. run key generator `ssh-keygen` and accept all default answers till complete
3. This will generate two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (check by doing `ls -la`)
    - id_rsa is your private key which you should never share
    - id_rsa is your public key to share with places like github for logging in
4. Print you public key `cat id_rsa.pub`
5. Copy and paste the public key into github and to github enterprise




# Step 1
1. We have to go to https://git.generalassemb.ly/classwork/lord_of_the_objects and fork the repository to our own git.generalassembly account
1. Then we navigate to our classwork folder and clone this repository to our local machine
1. Then we need open up this folder in vs code
1. Then we need to open the index.html file in the browser
1. Then we need to go back to vs code and begin to edit the js/app.js file


# Step 2 - Check if file is linked
### At the very top of the file add `console.log("Linked")` or `alert("Linked")` just to verify everything is connected

```js
console.log("Linked.");
```

# Step 3 - Review all the data that you have been given and the html file

```js
// Dramatis Personae
const hobbits = [
  `Frodo Baggins`,
  `Samwise "Sam" Gamgee`,
  `Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck`,
  `Peregrin "Pippin" Took`
];

const buddies = [
  'Gandalf the Grey',
  'Legolas',
  'Gimli',
  'Strider',
  'Boromir'
];

const baddies = [
  "Sauron",
  "Saruman",
  "The Uruk-hai",
  "Orcs"
];

const lands = [
  'The-Shire',
  'Rivendell',
  'Mordor'
];
```

# Step 4 - Review the functions at the bottom of the file and see how they coinside with the JS
```js

# Step 5 Chapter 1

```js
// 1. create a section tag with an id of middle-earth

// 2. use a for loop to iterate over the lands array that does the following:

//   2a. creates an article tag (there should be one for each land when the loop is done)

//   2b. gives each land article an `id` tag of the corresponding land name

//   2c. includes an h1 with the name of the land inside each land article

//   2d. appends each land to the middle-earth section

// 3. append the section to the body of the DOM.
```

## 1
```js
// 1. create a section tag with an id of middle-earth
const sectionMiddleEarth = document.createElement("section");

sectionMiddleEarth.setAttribute('id', 'middle-earth')
```
## 2

```js
// 2. use a for loop to iterate over the lands array that does the following:
for (land of lands) {
  ...
}
```
## 2a
```js
//   2a. creates an article tag (there should be one for each land when the loop is done)
const newArticle = document.createElement("article");
```

## 2b
```js
//   2b. gives each land article an `id` tag of the corresponding land name
newArticle.setAttribute("id", land.toLowerCase());
```

## 2c
```js
//   2c. includes an h1 with the name of the land inside each land article
newArticle.innerHTML = `<h1>${land}</h1>`;
```

## 2d
```js
//   2d. appends each land to the middle-earth section
sectionMiddleEarth.appendChild(newArticle);
```

## 3
```js
// 3. append the section to the body of the DOM.
document.body.appendChild(sectionMiddleEarth);
```
## Altogether
```js
// ============
// Chapter 1
// ============

function makeMiddleEarth() {
  console.log("1: makeMiddleEarth");

  // 1. create a section tag with an id of middle-earth
  const sectionMiddleEarth = document.createElement("section");

  sectionMiddleEarth.setAttribute('id', 'middle-earth')

  // 2. use a for loop to iterate over the lands array that does the following:
  for (land of lands) {
    //   2a. creates an article tag (there should be one for each land when the loop is done)
    const newArticle = document.createElement("article");
    //   2b. gives each land article an `id` tag of the corresponding land name
    newArticle.setAttribute("id", land.toLowerCase());
    //   2c. includes an h1 with the name of the land inside each land article
    newArticle.innerHTML = `<h1>${land}</h1>`;
    //   2d. appends each land to the middle-earth section
    sectionMiddleEarth.appendChild(newArticle);
  }
  // 3. append the section to the body of the DOM.
  document.body.appendChild(sectionMiddleEarth);
}
```
