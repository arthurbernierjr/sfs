## Practical Homework Assignment: Create a Clickable Button

### Goal

Create a clickable button that changes color and displays a message when clicked.

### Instructions

1. Go to [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) and create a new sandbox.
2. Add a new HTML file called `index.html` to your sandbox.
3. Inside the `body` element of `index.html`, create a `button` element with the text "Click Me!".
4. Add a CSS style to the `button` element that sets its background color to blue and text color to white.
5. Add a JavaScript event listener to the `button` element that changes the background color to green and displays the message "Button clicked!" when the button is clicked.

### Requirements

- The button should be centered horizontally on the page.
- The button should have a minimum width of 200 pixels and a height of 50 pixels.
- The button should have a cursor that changes to a pointer when hovered over.
- The button should change color and display the message "Button clicked!" when clicked.
- The HTML, CSS, and JS should be properly formatted and commented.

### Tips

- You can use the `text-align` property in CSS to center the button horizontally on the page.
- You can use the `cursor` property in CSS to change the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the button.
- You can use the `addEventListener()` method in JavaScript to add a click event listener to the button.
- You can use the `style` property in JavaScript to change the button's background color and display a message.

### Submission

When you're finished, copy the URL of your sandbox and submit it to your instructor.


## Theoretical Homework Assignment: FizzBuzz

### Goal

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

### Instructions

1. Go to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and create a new pen.
2. Create a new JavaScript file by clicking on the "JS" tab at the bottom of the screen.
3. Write a JavaScript program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 following the rules above.
4. Test your program by running it using the "Console" feature in CodePen.
5. Submit your CodePen URL to your instructor.

### Requirements

- The program should print the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, the program should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, the program should print "FizzBuzz".
- The program should be written in JavaScript and should be submitted as a CodePen URL.
- The program should be properly formatted and commented.

### Tips

- You can use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100.
- You can use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if a number is divisible by another number.
- You can use the `console.log()` method to print output to the console.

### Submission

When you're finished, copy the URL of your CodePen and submit it to your instructor.
