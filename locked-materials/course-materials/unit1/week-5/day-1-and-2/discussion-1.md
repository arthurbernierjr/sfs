## [The Code](https://replit.com/@ArthurBernier/Connect-Four-Game-Donna-Frances#style.css)

_In this class, we'll be analyzing a Connect Four game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We'll be breaking into our groups to discuss the code in detail, aiming to understand how all the components work together._

<hr>

During the breakout sessions, we'll discuss the following topics:

1. The purpose of the `COLORS` constant and its usage throughout the code.
1. The structure of the `board` variable and its representation of the game state.
1. The role of event listeners in the code and their impact on user interactions.
1. The `init()` function and its role in setting up the initial game state.
1. The `handleDrop()` function and how it updates the game state based on user input.
1. The different functions used to check for a winner (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal wins).
1. The `countAdjacent()` function and its role in determining a win.
1. The `render()` function and its role in updating the DOM based on the game state.
1. The conditional rendering of game elements such as the "Play Again" button and markers.
1. The HTML structure and CSS styling and how they work together with the JavaScript code to create the final Connect Four game.
