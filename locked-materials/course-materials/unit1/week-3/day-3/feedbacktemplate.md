# Week 1

The Week 1 homework consists of one written assignment, one practical assignment, and one theoretical assignment. The purpose of this homework is to help students build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, which are essential skills for web development.

## Written

In the written assignment, students are required to answer a series of questions related to HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive web design. This helps students to deepen their understanding of these concepts and their roles in web development.

## Practical 
The practical assignment involves creating a clickable button that changes color and displays a message when clicked. This assignment helps students to apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interactive element on a webpage.

## Theoretical
The theoretical assignment, known as the FizzBuzz problem, requires students to write a JavaScript program that follows specific rules to print numbers from 1 to 100. This assignment helps students practice their programming skills, particularly control structures like loops and conditionals, which are crucial for writing more complex JavaScript code.

## Summary
Overall, the Week 1 homework is designed to ensure that students have a solid understanding of the core concepts and skills needed for web development before moving on to more advanced topics.

# Week 2

The Week 2 homework consists of one written assignment, one practical assignment, and one theoretical assignment. The purpose of this homework is to help students develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts, such as Functions, Scope, Loops, Closure, and problem-solving using programming patterns.

## Written
In the written assignment, students are required to answer a series of questions related to JavaScript, such as loops, variable declarations, closures, and the event loop. This helps students to deepen their understanding of JavaScript and its features, which are crucial for web development.

## Practical

The practical assignment involves creating a simple counter application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This assignment helps students apply their knowledge of Functions, Scope, Loops, and Closure in a practical context, building a functional web application that reinforces these important JavaScript concepts.

## Theoretical

The theoretical assignment, known as the MaxSum problem, requires students to write a JavaScript program that finds the character that is most commonly used in a given string. This assignment helps students practice their programming skills, particularly problem-solving using programming patterns, such as the frequency counter pattern.

## Summary

Overall, the Week 2 homework is designed to ensure that students have a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts and skills needed for web development before moving on to more advanced topics.
