# Pair and Group Programming

During this class you will be expected to practice both Pair and Group Programming, this is a part
of the class experience and is imperative that everyone buy in and take part in the process.

You can read this article about [why we practice pair programming](https://karimfanous.substack.com/p/pair-programming-why-you-should-do) and this of course valuable for teaching but also at many top tech companies this is the standard.

You don't normally sit by yourself in a room coding in a vaccuum. You are part of a team trying to solve problems.

When high profile people want to be healthy they gather a team of doctors, not just one doctor to help them solve their challenges.

# Your Job

Sometimes in the course you will be put in breakout rooms of either a pair, or in a group.

## When in a pair
1. One student will be what's called the driver and One student will be the navigator
1. The navigator talks to the driver but never types and directs the driver where to go like gps.
1. The driver follows the instructions of the navigator, and may give feedback but whoever is the navigator is currently running the show.
1. No one should always be navigator or driver.
1. Driver should be sharing their screen.

## When in a group
1. One person should be sharing their screen and the team should collaborate like you would at a corporate meeting.
1. The person sharing their screen should act as the Recorder and should be taking the meetings minutes
1. Everyone should be communicating.
1. Once the breakout room closes whoever was Recording should share what they recorded with the entire group

# What is not permissable
1. Its not ok to go into your breakout room turn your camera off and not interact with the class.
1. Its not ok to go into your breakout room and do the work that was previously assigned instead of what the breakout room is working on.
1. It is not ok to choose to do your homework instead of the activity your group is working on.
1. Its not ok to speak over other students in the breakout room.
1. Its not ok to give solutions to problems in the breakout room without an explanation.(i.e copy it from google and just give it to your team mates)
1. Its not ok to google the answers to problems as opposed to doing the proper research via MDN, W3C, ECMAScript docs etc.

# Tips
1. If your not using documentation in breakout rooms your not going to find the answers.
1. If your not reviewing the class material your not going to find the answers.
1. If your not using the written bonus texts in the breakout rooms your not going to find the texts.
1. If your not working together your not going to find the answers.
