# Communication
- Feedback goes both directions, we love getting/giving feedback at GA
- Let us know how you're doing and how we can improve your experience

## Communication Tools

<br>


### Slack

#### 4 channels

- **`seirflex-hypatia-classroom`**
- **`seirflex-hypatia-outcomes`**
- **`seirflex-hypatia-techtalk`**
- **`seirflex-hypatia-partytime`**
- **`seirflex-hypatia-resources`**

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### How To:

<br>



##### Communicate in one of the outrun channels:

**`@username`**
  - sends a notification to a specific user

**`@channel / @here`**
  - sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
  - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/TAs use this)


<br>
<br>
<br>


##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately

<br>
<br>
<br>



##### Other:

- You can mute channels that you no longer need (e.g. Fundamentals)
- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages


<br>
<br>
