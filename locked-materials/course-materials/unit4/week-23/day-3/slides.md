Designing a system like Twitter from scratch is like building a house from the ground up. You gotta have a plan, and you gotta make sure it's solid.

First, we gotta make sure that the house stays standing, even if a storm comes through. We gotta have 5 nines of availability, which means that the house (or the website) has to be up and running 99.999% of the time. That's like building a house on stilts, so that it can handle a flood or a hurricane.

Next, we gotta make sure the house can fit all the people who wanna come through. We gotta be able to handle 100 million users, that's like building a house with a lot of rooms, so that everyone can have a place to stay.

To do this, we're gonna need a big front door, that's like a load balancer. The load balancer is gonna make sure that everyone who comes through the front door is directed to the right place.

Once inside, we're gonna need a lot of rooms, that's like having a lot of servers. The servers are gonna handle all the different requests and make sure that everyone has a place to stay.

We're also gonna need a way to keep track of everyone's stuff, that's like having a database. The database is gonna store all the tweets and the user information, so that we can keep track of everything.

Finally, we're gonna need a way to keep the place clean, that's like having monitoring and logging. We're gonna need to keep an eye on everything that's going on in the house, so that we can make sure that everything is running smoothly and fix any problems that come up.

So, in short, designing a system like Twitter from scratch is like building a house from the ground up, you gotta have a plan, and you gotta make sure it's solid. We gotta make sure the house stays standing, even if a storm comes through, by having 5 nines of availability, We gotta make sure the house can fit all the people who wanna come through by being able to handle 100 million users, by having a big front door, that's like a load balancer, a lot of rooms, that's like having a lot of servers, a way to keep track of everyone's stuff, that's like having a database, and a way to keep the place clean, that's like having monitoring and logging.

## Keeping that in mind you can use that framework to explain how to build anything

## Myspace

To build a system like MySpace from scratch, the basic architecture would be similar to that of building a system like Twitter, we would use a variety of different technologies such as Load balancer, Servers, Database, Monitoring and Logging, Cloud Infrastructure, Content Delivery Network and Security measures to ensure the site is fast, secure and can handle the high volume of requests and data.

However, there would be some key differences in the way we would build MySpace vs Twitter.

- MySpace was heavily focused on personalization and customization of profile pages, which would require more complex front-end design and development. This would require a different approach in terms of front-end technologies and tools to support user-generated content and personalization features.
- MySpace also had a more complex social networking feature, which would require more advanced back-end logic and data modeling to support features like friend connections, messaging and groups.
- MySpace also had a music feature which would require additional storage and bandwidth to handle large audio files and streaming capabilities.
- In terms of scalability, MySpace's user base grew rapidly in a short period of time, so it would require more advanced techniques to handle the sudden increase in traffic and data, such as horizontal scaling and distributed systems.

In summary, while the basic architecture of building a system like MySpace and Twitter would be similar, the key differences would lie in the front-end design and development, back-end logic and data modeling, music feature, and scalability. To build a system like MySpace, it would require more advanced technologies and techniques to handle the complex features and sudden increase in traffic and data.
