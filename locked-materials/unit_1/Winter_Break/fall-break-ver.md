# Fall Break Extras - Staying sharp 

The following is a list of **extra** suggested activities you can choose from to do if you've already finished the required homework and want to take advantage of this off time. Remember that you get out of this course whatever you put into it. This short but sweet fall break is a fairly unique opporunity to spend a few extra days to catch up on whatever you're struggling in if you have the time.

## Suggestions:

  - Make a list of level up goals and prioritize what is most important to you
